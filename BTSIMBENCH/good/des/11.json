On the chopping board, there are a knife and an onion placed on it. The robot is initially located in the kitchen. The robot needs to put the onion on the chopping board, uses gripper to fix the onion position, then use the knife to chop the onion into diced onion, then place the knife inside sink in the kitchen. The goal is to get diced onion, and the knife is placed inside the sink. The robot has two grippers, which one gripper can hold one object at a time.",
