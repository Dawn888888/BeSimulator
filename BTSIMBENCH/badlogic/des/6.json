    "bt_task": "The robot task is to box leftover kabobs after dinner and store them in an electric refrigerator. The behavior logic of a robot should be as follows. There are two cooked kabobs, each placed on separate plates on the breakfast table. And a fresh preservation box is also on the breakfast table. And the box is closed nitially. The robot needs to place two kabobs into the fresh preservation box, then store the box in the electric refrigerator located in the kitchen and finally close the refrigerator. The goal is to ensure that the two kabobs are inside the fresh preservation box, the box is inside the refrigerator, and the refrigerator is closed.",
