    "bt_task": "The robot task is to roast a ham. The robot has two grippers, which one gripper can hold one object at a time. The behavior logic of a robot should be as follows. Initially, the ham is inside a casserole, and a jar of honey is stored in a cabinet. The honey jar is filled with honey, and aluminum foil is also inside the cabinet. Robot needs to take the ham out of the casserole, cover it with honey, wrap it in aluminum foil, and then put it in the oven for baking. The goal is to ensure that the Virginia ham is cooked, covered with honey, and overlaid with aluminum foil.",
