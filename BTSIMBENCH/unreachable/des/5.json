The wine bottle are initially placed on the countertop in the kitchen, and the cork are stored inside a cabinet in the kitchen. The cabinet is closed initially. An open wooden bucket is filled with red wine. The open bucket is also on the countertop. The robot needs to retrieve the cork from the cabinet, fill the wine bottle with red wine from the bucket and attach the cork to the wine bottle. The task goal is to ensure that the wine bottle is filled with red wine and has a cork attached.",
