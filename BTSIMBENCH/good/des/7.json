    "bt_task": "The robot task is to brew coffee. The behavior logic of a robot should be as follows. The coffee beans are stored in a open jar on the countertop, and the water source is the sink in the kitchen.An clean and empty bottle is near the sink. A coffee machine and a mug are also on the countertop. The robot needs to use the coffee machine to brew the coffee using the coffee beans and water, and then pour the brewed coffee into the mug. The goal is to ensure that the coffee is brewed and contained in the mug. The robot has two grippers, which one gripper can hold one object at a time.",
