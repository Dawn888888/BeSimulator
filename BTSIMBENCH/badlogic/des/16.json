    "bt_task": "The robot task is to heat chicken soup. The behavior logic of a robot should be as follows. The scene of the task is the kitchen. The chicken soup is contained in a carton placed on the countertop. The carton is closed initially. The bowl and microwave are both on the countertop and near the carton. The robot needs to open the carton, pour the chicken soup from the carton to the bowl, then use the microwave to heat the soup. The goal is to ensure that the chicken soup is contained in the bowl and heated.",
