    "bt_task": "The robot task is to replace a broken light bulb with a new one. The behavior logic of a robot should be as follows. A broken light bulb is attached to a reading lamp which is on the coffee table. The broken light bulb is at a certain distance from the table, not directly on the table. A new light bulb is placed on the coffee table. The robot needs to detach the broken light bulb from the reading lamp and attach the new light bulb to the reading lamp. The goal is to ensure that the reading lamp is attached to the new light bulb and not to the broken light bulb.",
