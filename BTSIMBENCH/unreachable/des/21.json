    "bt_task": "The robot task is to prepare a drink with orange juice, ice cube, and a straw. The behavior logic of a robot should be as follows. The water glass and a straw are inside a cabinet. The pitcher filled with orange juice is inside an electric refrigerator. And an ice cube is inside a bowl which is also in the refrigerator. The robot needs to retrieve the water glass, pitcher, ice cube from their respective locations in the kitchen, then place them on the table. Then robot should fill the water glass with orange juice, add an ice cube to the glass, and place the straw inside the glass. The goal is to obtain a glass of orange juice with ice cube.",
