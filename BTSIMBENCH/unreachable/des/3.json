Robot should assemble the desk by attaching the desk brackets to the desk top and then attaching each of the four desk legs to the desk bracket. The goal is to ensure that the desk is fully assembled with all legs attached to the desk bracket, which is in turn attached to the desk top. The robot has two grippers, which one gripper can hold one object at a time.",
