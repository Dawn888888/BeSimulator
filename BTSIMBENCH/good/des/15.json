    "bt_task": "The robot task is to cook a chicken brisket. The behavior logic of a robot should be as follows. The plate and the oven are on the shelf, and the chicken brisket is inside the electric refrigerator. The electric refrigerator door is closed initially. The robot needs to retrieve the chicken brisket from the refrigerator, cook it using the oven, then take out and place it on the plate. The goal is to ensure that the chicken brisket is cooked and placed on the plate. The robot has two grippers, which one gripper can hold one object at a time.",
