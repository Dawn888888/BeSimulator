## üì¶ Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Dawn888888/BeSimulator.git
    cd BeSimulator
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    conda create --name besimulator python=3.9
    conda activate besimulator
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Before running BeSimulator, you must set up your API keys.
```
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
```

*Replace the placeholder text with your actual API keys.*

## üöÄ Quick Start

Here is a basic example to run a Behavior Tree (BT) simulation using the DeepSeek model.

    ```
    python main.py --llm_model deepseek-chat --category good --run_task_id 1
    ```
