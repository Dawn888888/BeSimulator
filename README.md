# BeSimulator: A Large Language Model Powered Text-based Behavior Simulator

A modular LLM-powered framework designed to efficiently simulate BTs, FSMs, HTNs, etc., as an effort towards behavior simulation in text-based environments.

# Get Start

 Here is an example to run a BT simulation.

`python main.py --llm_model deepseek-chat --category good --run_task_id 1`
