The bicycle is initially on the floor, and the bicycle rack is attached to a wall nail. The environment is set in a garage. The robot needs to move the bicycle from the floor and attach it to the bicycle rack. The goal is to ensure that the bicycle is securely attached to the bicycle rack on the wall.",
