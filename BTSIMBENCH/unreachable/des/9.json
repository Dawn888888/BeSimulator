The water bottle is initially on a shelf in the bathroom, and the sink also located in the bathroom contains water. The backpack is on the floor in the kitchen. The robot needs to fill the water bottle with water from the sink, move the water bottle to the kitchen and place it next to the backpack. The goal is to ensure that the water bottle is filled with water, placed next to the backpack on the kitchen floor.",
